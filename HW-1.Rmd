## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Nina, Amanda, Katherine, Brenda 
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far: 4 hours 
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](http://rpubs.com/kyragray/213420).
* What gave you the most trouble: overriding my data frames and not knowing how to reverse my mistake 
* Any comments you have:





## Question 1:

Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
 
* the x-axis should be some notion of time
* the y-axis should be the proportion.

Using this plot, indicate describe the
[seasonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality) of when delays over 30
minutes tend to occur.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 3:

* What states did Southwest Airlines' **flight paths** tend to fly to?
* What states did Southwest Airlines' **flights** tend to fly to?

For example, Southwest Airlines Flight 60 to Dallas consists of a single flight
path, but since it flew 299 times in 2013, it would be counted as 299 flights.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 4:

I want to know proportionately what regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to/from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```
